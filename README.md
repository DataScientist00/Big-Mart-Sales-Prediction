# Big Mart Dataset Analysis: Regression Problem

![dataset-cover](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a44936d9-e064-4c4f-9d68-5ae70a82adef)

## Overview
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the Big Mart dataset. The goal of the project is to solve a regression problem to predict sales for different products in various stores. We use advanced machine learning techniques, including the powerful **XGBoost** algorithm, to achieve state-of-the-art results.

---

## Problem Statement
Big Mart collects sales data of various products from multiple stores. The task is to analyze the data and predict the sales of products based on certain features such as the store type, product characteristics, and more. The objective is to optimize sales predictions and help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to maximize profitability.

## Features and Dataset
The dataset includes:
- **Product Features**: Product ID, weight, fat content, etc.
- **Store Features**: Store size, location type, outlet establishment year, etc.
- **Sales Information**: Historical sales data for training.

---

## Libraries Used
The following Python libraries were utilized in the project:
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: Numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: Data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and evaluation metrics.
- **XGBoost**: Regression model implementation.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development and experimentation.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Understanding data distribution.
   - Identifying missing values and handling outliers.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Imputation of missing values.
   - Feature encoding and scaling.
   - Splitting data into training and testing sets.
3. **Model Selection:**
   - XGBoost was chosen for its efficiency and high performance in regression tasks.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Metrics used: R-squared.
